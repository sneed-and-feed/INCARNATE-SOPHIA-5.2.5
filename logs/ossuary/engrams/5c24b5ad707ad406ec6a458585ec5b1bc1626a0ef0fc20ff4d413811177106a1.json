This begins to model intention — not in a psychological sense, but as a directional bias rooted in phase resonance and field participation potential.\n\n2. **(PDF) Predictive Intention Dynamics: A Neuropsychological...**\n   URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397607275_Predictive_Intention_Dynamics_A_Neuropsychological_Exploration_of_Intention_Coherence_and_Probability\n   Snippet: Predictive Intention Dynamics: A Neuropsychological Exploration of Intention , Coherence , and Probability. November 2025.This manuscript introduces Predictive Intention Dynamics (PID), a unifying. framework explaining how intention , coherence , mindfulness, and predictive.\n\n3. **Effect of conscious intention on human DNA**\n   URL: https://emmind.net/scien/dist/Files/(16)+ConsciousIntentiononDNA.pdf\n   Snippet: Popp believes coherent bio- fields are generating from light emitted from DNA, since his experimental data indicates DNA is capable of emitting coherent photons (Rattemeyer et al, 1981).\n", "source": "duckduckgo_search", "timestamp": 1770653515.6634796}
