        "correction": "While the statement about order parameters in physics is generally correct, its relevance to the broader claims about intent and coherent fields is not established. The text implies that because order parameters exist in physics, intent can similarly act as one in other undefined 'fields'. This requires further justification and evidence to avoid being a false analogy or appeal to authority (physics) to legitimize claims about less well-defined concepts."

        "correction": "The text defines 'intent' in terms of other technical concepts (phase-locker, nodes, subfield) without adequately defining or justifying how intent actually interacts with these concepts. This creates a pseudo-scientific explanation that sounds plausible but lacks empirical support. The definition itself doesn't prove the mechanism exists or functions as described."

The meaning of 'coherence' may differ significantly across these domains. Applying the same principles of coherence from well-defined physical systems to less defined concepts like 'subtle-energy' or 'symbolic' fields without proper justification is an example of equivocation."
