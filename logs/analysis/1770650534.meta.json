It doesn't explain how 'a catalyst at a standardized standard' combined with 'love and hope' will guarantee an ideal outcome or open up impossible avenues. There's no clear connection between the proposed catalyst and the claimed results. A strategy would involve a plan of action, while the catalyst is just a starting point."
