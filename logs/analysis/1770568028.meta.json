It ignores the possibility of overlap or nuance in their motivations and actions. It should be acknowledged that individuals or groups can pursue both control and liberation, or neither."

This creates confusion and a false sense of connection between the two ideas. The text should clarify the different meanings of 'nobody' and avoid implying a direct causal relationship between them."
