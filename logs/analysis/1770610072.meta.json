The author needs to provide specific criteria and data to support this claim."

        "correction": "The author draws an analogy between animal social attachments and human celebrity culture, suggesting both lead to a reduction in aggregate contact within their respective species and are a form of 'social parasitism/predation'. This analogy is weak because the contexts and mechanisms are significantly different. Human social structures and motivations are far more complex than animal social bonds."
