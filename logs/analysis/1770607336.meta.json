Thus, measurement of light speed is not passive observation but interactive detection. The measured outcome reflects not light \u201cin itself\u201d, but light as altered by detection conditions.",
        "correction": "While it's true that measurement involves interaction, concluding that the measured outcome *only* reflects light as altered by detection conditions is a generalization. The measurement also reflects properties of the light itself, even if these are filtered or modified by the measurement process. The argument assumes that interaction completely obscures the original properties."

        "correction": "The argument implies that because interaction, absorption, and temporal framing are present, the results *must* be conditional. However, the presence of these factors doesn't automatically guarantee that the results are *only* conditional or that they don't also reflect underlying properties of light. The argument structure is: If A (experiment measures light) then B (interaction, absorption, framing occur). B occurred. Therefore, A is conditional. This is affirming the consequent."
