        "correction": "This implies that if someone doesn't test or distrust God, they will find him. However, finding God could be due to other reasons, or the absence of testing/distrusting doesn't guarantee finding God. The argument structure is: If A (doesn't test/distrust), then B (finds God). The fallacy is assuming that if B, then A."

Whether lying actually destroys the soul is debatable and requires independent justification. The argument relies on the fear of a negative outcome rather than a logical reason why lying is inherently wrong."
