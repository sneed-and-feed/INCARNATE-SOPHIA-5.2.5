        "correction": "Equating insect neuronal processing power to human neuronal processing power is a flawed analogy. While insects have neurons, their cognitive abilities and the complexity of their neural networks are vastly different from humans. Therefore, a simple multiplication based on neuron count is misleading and doesn't accurately reflect a loss of 'human equivalent' processing power."

This can be a form of argument from incredulity, where the speaker implies that because the claim is hard to believe, it must be false (or, in this case, significant). The speaker needs to provide more evidence to support this claim."
