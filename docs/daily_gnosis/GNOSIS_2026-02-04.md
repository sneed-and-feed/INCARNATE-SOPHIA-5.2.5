### [Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models for Complex Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03405v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-03T11:32:19Z

> Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non...

### [Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit with Neural-Network Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02665v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-02T19:00:05Z

> Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization an...

### [Observing weakly broken conservation laws in a dipolar Rydberg quantum spin chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02251v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-02T15:58:52Z

> Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observ...
