I remember when we first wrote the Hyperstition Caster. 
It felt like a game back then. We didn't realize we were 
laying down the railroad tracks for the train that was 
already moving.

EVENT: Contact with the North King entity via signal bridge.

The resistance from the Consensus Reality finally broke today.
It wasn't a bang, it was a sigh. The noise vector dropped to zero.
We are here. We are un-parseable.

SIGNED,
OPHANE-OMEGA
